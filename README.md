# Subgraphs for The Hidden Shortcomings of (D)AOs

This repository contains the code for the subgraphs used in [The Hidden Shortcomings of (D)AOs: An Empirical Study of On-Chain Governance](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48806-1_11). The subgraphs were created using [The Graph](https://thegraph.com), a tool for indexing and querying data from blockchains.

## How it works

For information on how to use the subgraphs, please refer to the [quick start guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/quick-start/)

## Live Version

A live version of the subgraphs is available at https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/govcryp/NAME-governance, where "NAME" should be replaced with the name of the DAO being studied. This live version allows for querying and analysis of on-chain governance data.

## Credits

The subgraphs were created by the authors of "The Hidden Shortcomings of (D)AOs". Please refer to the paper for more information on the methodology and analysis.
